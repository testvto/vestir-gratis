This plugin creates and manages html tables for wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin creates and manages tables for wordpress. So you can post i.e. sport results in a fixed table format. 
You don't need to enter tables anymore in the plain text mode and the WYSIWYG editor didn't damage the table layout. 
The table layout can be changed via a css file and you can import a csv file as table.
